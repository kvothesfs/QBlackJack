Game Overview
Quantum Black Jack is a browser-based 3D game built with Three.js, combining the classic card game Black Jack with quantum mechanics for an educational and entertaining experience. Players bet and play against a dealer, but with a twist: cards can enter superposition (existing in multiple states) and be entangled (linked so their outcomes correlate). This design aims to be fun, polished, and viral-worthy, while teaching players about quantum concepts.

Gameplay Mechanics
Core Rules: Players aim for a hand value close to 21 without busting, competing against the dealer, following standard Black Jack rules.
Quantum Twist: Each card has two possible states (e.g., 5 of Spades or 9 of Hearts), each with a probability. Cards start collapsed (definite state) but can be put into superposition using Hadamard chips, collapsed using Schrödinger chips, or entangled using Entanglement chips to force matching colors upon collapse.
Economy: Players bet with in-game money, track earnings, and can buy chips (Hadamard/Schrödinger at 100 units, Entanglement at 150 units).
Visual and Interactive Experience
3D Environment: A vibrant green table with animated 3D cards, using textured planes for card faces, enhancing immersion.
Superposition Visuals: Superposed cards shimmer in cyan, pulsing and wobbling to show uncertainty, reflecting quantum weirdness.
Entanglement Effects: Entangled cards glow magenta with a connecting line, visually linking them for educational impact.
Collapse Animations: Cards pulse and flash during collapse, mimicking wavefunction collapse, with sound effects for engagement.
Educational Features
In-Game Explanations: Tooltips explain actions in quantum terms, e.g., "Hadamard chip puts card in superposition, existing in both states."
Didactic Design: Gameplay teaches superposition (dual states), entanglement (correlated outcomes), and collapse (measurement resolving uncertainty), making learning interactive.
Viral-Worthy Elements
Polished Graphics: Smooth animations, particle effects, and responsive design for all devices, aiming for shareability.
Social Features: Include options to share scores or achievements on social media, potentially via X or other platforms, to boost virality.
Engagement: Clear UI, intuitive controls, and leaderboards for competitive fun, encouraging players to share and challenge friends.
Survey Note: Detailed Design of "Quantum Black Jack"
This section provides a comprehensive outline for designing "Quantum Black Jack," a browser-based 3D game using Three.js, focusing on fun, polish, educational value, and viral potential. The game integrates quantum mechanics into Black Jack, offering an immersive experience that teaches players about quantum concepts while being engaging enough to go viral.

Game Concept and Mechanics
"Quantum Black Jack" starts with standard Black Jack rules: players aim for a hand value close to 21 without exceeding it, competing against a dealer. The quantum twist introduces cards with two possible states, each with a probability, reflecting superposition. Initially, cards are collapsed (definite state), but players can use chips to manipulate their quantum states:

Hadamard Chips: Put a card into superposition, where it exists in both states simultaneously, visually represented by cyan shimmering and pulsing.
Schrödinger Chips: Collapse a superposed card to one state based on probabilities, with animated flashes to show measurement.
Entanglement Chips: Link two superposed cards, ensuring they collapse to states of the same color (e.g., both black or red), with magenta glows and connecting lines for visual correlation.
The economy involves betting with in-game money, tracking earnings, and buying chips (Hadamard/Schrödinger at 100 units, Entanglement at 150 units), adding strategic depth.

Three.js Implementation
The game leverages Three.js for a 3D browser-based experience, ensuring accessibility and performance. Key implementation details include:

Scene Setup: A green felt table (plane mesh) with positions for player's and dealer's hands, using ambient lighting for clarity.
Card Rendering: Cards are textured planes, with images for each traditional card state. Each quantum card has two textures, switching or blending during superposition.
Animations:
Superposition: Cards pulse in size and wobble, with rapid texture switching between states, emphasizing quantum uncertainty.
Entanglement: A magenta line or particle system connects entangled cards, updating dynamically as cards move.
Collapse: Cards scale and fade during collapse, with a flash effect and optional sound, mimicking wavefunction collapse.
User Interaction: Raycasting handles mouse clicks for card selection, with visual feedback (e.g., glow) for selected cards. Buttons for actions (hit, stand, use chips) ensure intuitive controls.
Game Flow and User Interface
The game flow mirrors Black Jack with quantum enhancements:

Betting Phase: Player bets money, dealer deals two cards each (one dealer card face down).
Player's Turn: Player sees their cards and dealer's face-up card, can:
Hit: Draw another card (initially collapsed).
Stand: End turn, triggering collapse of superposed cards.
Use Hadamard chip: Put selected card into superposition.
Use Schrödinger chip: Collapse selected superposed card.
Use Entanglement chip: Link two superposed cards for color correlation.
End of Turn: Any remaining superposed cards collapse, hand value calculated (sum of collapsed values, Aces as 1 or 11).
Dealer's Turn: Dealer reveals face-down card, hits on 16, stands on 17 (standard rules).
Resolution: Compare hands, award winnings or deduct losses, update chip counts.
The UI includes:

Display of money, chip counts, and hand value (showing "uncertain" for superposed cards, with min/max possible values).
Buttons for actions, with tooltips explaining quantum effects.
Responsive design for desktop and mobile, ensuring accessibility.
Educational Value
The game's didactic purpose is to teach quantum mechanics through interactive play, with in-game explanations:

Superposition: Cards in cyan, pulsing, show dual states; tooltips explain, "Card is in both states until measured."
Entanglement: Magenta glow and lines illustrate correlation; explain, "Cards linked, measuring one affects the other."
Collapse: Flash animations and sounds demonstrate measurement resolving uncertainty; explain, "Collapse picks a state based on probabilities."
A tutorial mode at start introduces concepts, and periodic pop-ups reinforce learning during gameplay, making it educational for all ages.

Viral-Worthy Features
To achieve viral potential, the game includes:

Polished Graphics: High-quality 3D models, smooth animations, and particle effects for quantum phenomena, enhancing visual appeal.
Engagement: Leaderboards for high scores, achievements for mastering quantum strategies, and shareable screenshots or scores on X.
Social Sharing: Buttons to share gameplay highlights, potentially with hashtags like #QuantumBlackJack, encouraging virality.
Accessibility: Browser-based, no downloads, works on all devices, with intuitive UI for broad appeal.
Technical Considerations
Performance: Optimize Three.js for browser performance, using LOD for cards, and limiting particle effects for mobile.
Assets: Use free card image sets (e.g., from OpenGameArt), ensuring legal use.
Testing: Ensure cross-browser compatibility, with testing on Chrome, Firefox, and mobile browsers.
